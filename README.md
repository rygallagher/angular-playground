# Angular Playground
This project is to play around with angular components, modern design practices, and any interesting npm packages.

## Themes
Currently, nine color palettes are supported for both dark and light modes.
They are blue, brown, gray, green, orange, pink, purple, red, and yellow.

## Material Calendar Widget
The calendar is a stationary material calendar only previewing the current month and day.

The digital clock follows the format 'hh:mm:ss a (z)' on a 300ms update interval. Example: 12:50:24 PM (GMT-5)
